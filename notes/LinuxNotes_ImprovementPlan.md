---

### Step 1.2: Redistribute "Other Important Commands" Section
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-11-15
**Depends on:** Step 1.1

**Actions:**
1. Identify all commands in Section 25 "Other Important Commands" (was lines 5941-6047)
2. Redistribute to logical sections:
   - `date`, `timedatectl` → System Information section (17.7, 17.8)
   - `bc`, `cal` → System Information section as utilities (17.9, 17.10)
   - `script` → Shell section (13.8)
3. Remove now-empty Section 25
4. Update ToC

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] All commands from Section 25 reassigned
- [x] Commands placed in logical sections
- [x] Section 25 removed
- [x] ToC updated
- [x] All subsequent sections renumbered (26→25, 27→26, 28→27, 29→28, 30→29, 31→30)

**Commands Redistributed:**
- date → Section 17.7 (System Information)
- timedatectl → Section 17.8 (System Information)
- bc → Section 17.9 (System Information)
- cal → Section 17.10 (System Information)

---

### Step 1.3: Split "Advanced Topics" Section
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Modified Approach)
**Completed:** 2025-11-15
**Depends on:** Step 1.2

**Actions:**
1. Review Section 29 "Advanced Topics"
2. Move systemd-analyze to Section 10 (systemd)
3. Fix subsection numbering inconsistencies (30.x → 29.x)
4. Update ToC

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] systemd-analyze moved to Section 10.9
- [x] All subsection numbering fixed in Section 29
- [x] ToC updated for both sections
- [x] Section 29 remains as "Advanced Topics"

**Completion Notes:**
- **Decision:** Kept Section 29 as "Advanced Topics" rather than splitting into multiple sections
- **Rationale:** The content in Section 29 is legitimately advanced/miscellaneous topics (NFS, LVM intro, SELinux, Stratis, RAID, Samba, Docker, Podman, etc.). Creating multiple new sections would fragment the document excessively. The "Advanced Topics" catch-all section serves a useful purpose for topics that don't fit elsewhere.
- Successfully moved systemd-analyze from Section 29.4 → Section 10.9
- Fixed all subsection numbering (some were incorrectly numbered as 30.x)
- Section 29 now has: 29.1 (NFS), 29.2 (LVM), 29.3 (SELinux), 29.4 (Other Advanced Features)
- Added systemd-analyze with subsection 10.9.1 (Key Features)
- Updated ToC entries for both sections
- Document structure remains at 30 sections total

**Depends on:** Step 1.3

**Actions:**
1. Merge "Environment Variables" (Section 20) into "Shell" section (Section 13) as subsection 13.9
2. Decide on "Terminal" section (Section 14):
   - Option A: Merge with Shell section
   - Option B: Keep as standalone section
3. Remove old Section 20 and renumber sections 21-30 to 20-29
4. Update ToC and cross-references

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Environment Variables integrated into Shell section as 13.9
- [x] Terminal section kept as standalone (sufficient content with tty vs pts)
- [x] Old Section 20 removed
- [x] Sections 21-30 renumbered to 20-29
- [x] ToC updated with new structure
- [x] All subsections renumbered correctly

**Decision:** Terminal section kept as standalone - contains 64 lines of focused content on terminal types (tty vs pts) which justifies its own section.

**Completion Notes:**
- Successfully merged Environment Variables into Shell section as subsection 13.9
- Environment Variables content (57 lines) moved from old Section 20 to new Section 13.9
- Kept Terminal as standalone Section 14 (64 lines covering tty vs pts)

- Updated ToC entries for:
  - Added Section 13.8 (script Command)
  - Added Section 13.9 (Environment Variables)
  - Removed old Section 20 entry
  - Renumbered all ToC entries for sections 21-30 to 20-29
